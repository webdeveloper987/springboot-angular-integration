= IntelliJ AsciiDoc Plugin
Erik Pragt
:experimental:

A plugin for the IntelliJ platform (IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, etc) that provides support for the http://www.asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] markup language. You can install the plugin (named "AsciiDoc") from the plugins section inside your Jetbrains IDE or download it from the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391[Jetbrains Plugin Repository].

If you want to use the JavaFX instead of the Swing preview, you'll need to run IntelliJ with 64bit Java.
From 2017.1 onwards 64bit Java is included even in the Windows versions.
See https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544879-Selecting-the-JDK-version-the-IDE-will-run-under for more information.

If your IntelliJ distribution doesn't come with 64bit Java, you'll need to have an environment variable `IDEA_JDK` or `IDEA_JDK64` pointing to the installation folder of a 64bit Java.
See https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544879-Selecting-the-JDK-version-the-IDE-will-run-under[Jetbrains support database] for more information.

== Dependencies

This project uses AsciiDoctorJ and JRuby for the rendering of the AsciiDoc content.

For the conversion of Markdown to AsciiDoc, we use Pegdown and the https://github.com/bodiam/markdown-to-asciidoc[Markdown to AsciiDoc] converter.

== Build

This plugin is built using Gradle.
If you build or run it the first time it will download the community edition of IntelliJ automatically.

If you have developed the plugin before it changed to Gradle you might want to remove the contents of your `.idea` folder to trigger a re-import of the Gradle project.

To build this plugin, you need to run:

----
./gradlew -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 buildPlugin
----

The ZIP file with plugin to distribute will be located in `build/distributions`.

To run the plugin for development you'll need to start

----
./gradlew -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 runIdea
----
